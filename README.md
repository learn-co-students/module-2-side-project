### Side Project

### Objective
* Solidify concepts and content covered in this module
* By using the information from each lesson learned, you can build your side project connecting all of the pieces

#### Requirements
* At least 2 models (1 has_many - belongs_to)
* Make at least one of your controllers full CRUD (Create Read Update Destroy)
* Some methods in your models. There should be at least 3 methods total across all of your models. These are to be used to better extract data from your tables (Ex. methods that execute ActiveRecord queries)

#### Bonus
* Create a has_many through
* Use an external API to seed your database

##### Timeline
* Come up with idea, model out domain
* Create and run your migrations, correctly establish relationships (NOTE* You can add more down the line but be sure to test your relationships before attempting to build out features)
* Establish which routes are needed for the appropriate controller
* Create your views
* Start building out basic features
* It doesnt' have to be perfect, but it should be working
